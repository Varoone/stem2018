Hi, I am Varoone Meduri, I am learning python and data dictionaries. I created a sample application with my dad that loads JSON based science and geographical data that can be used for finding facts about states and chemical elements on the periodic table.
To use this program you need to download the data folder and run the search service using Python. I hope you enjoy my program



Sincerly,
Varoone
